# exprparser
A C++20-based expression parser and abstract syntax tree (AST) generator. This project implements a tokenizer (lexer), grammar rules, and a recursive descent parser to convert mathematical or programming language expressions into an AST. The AST can be traversed or printed for analysis, interpretation, or further compilation.
